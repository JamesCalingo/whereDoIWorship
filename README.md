# whereDoIWorship
Find places of worship near you!

# How it works
All you need to do is select which religion you're looking for places of worship for, allow the page access to your location, and it will find nearby results.

# Coming soon
This app is currently wholly dependant on geolocation

Also, IMO, "Christian" is a bit too broad to be useful. I plan on implementing a way to search by Christan Denominations very soon.
