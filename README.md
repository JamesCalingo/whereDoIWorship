Find places of worship near you!

# How it works
All you need to do is select which religion you're looking for places of worship for, allow the page access to your location, and it will find nearby results.

# Coming soon
This app is currently wholly dependant on geolocation. I am working on adding an input field where the user can specify a location to search for houses of worship.

Also, if you can think of any religions/denominations I may have missed in the dropdown menu, let me know!
