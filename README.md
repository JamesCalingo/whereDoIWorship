# whereDoIWorship
Find places of worship near you!

# How it works
All you need to do is select which religion you're looking for places of worship for, allow the page access to your location, and it will find nearby results.

Alternatively, you can use the input field to select a location/address using the Google Places API, and then you can search from that location.

Perfect for your next business trip/vacation!

Also, if you can think of any religions/denominations I may have missed in the dropdown menu, let me know!
